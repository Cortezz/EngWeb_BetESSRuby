# Engenharia Web (Web Engineering)

Assignment whose purpose was to get "acquainted" with Ruby. In order to do so, one had to develop BetESS (previously written in C#) in Ruby.

The structure is as follows:
  ```
  |
  | -- \lib - All source files regarding the application are here.
  | -- \test - Here lie the unit testing files.
  ```
  
If for some very weird reason you wish to run this application, just do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Cortezz/EngWeb_BetESSRuby.git
```
Now you're good to go!

```
<Project Folder>
cd lib
ruby main.rb
```
